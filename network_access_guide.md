# Network Access Solutions for University Networks

## üè´ University Network Issues
University networks often have security restrictions that prevent external device access. Here are several solutions:

## Option 1: Mobile Hotspot (Recommended)
1. **Create a mobile hotspot** from your phone
2. **Connect your laptop** to the hotspot
3. **Connect other devices** to the same hotspot
4. **Start the server**: `python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0`
5. **Share your IP**: Others can access via your new IP address

## Option 2: File Sharing
1. **Copy the files** to a USB drive or cloud storage
2. **Share with teammates** who can run locally
3. **Each person runs**: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
4. **Access locally**: `http://localhost:8000`

## Option 3: Cloud Deployment (Advanced)
- Deploy to **GitHub Pages** (free)
- Use **Netlify** for hosting
- Upload to **Google Drive** and share

## Option 4: Direct File Access
- Simply **double-click** the `index.html` file
- **Works without any server** - opens directly in browser
- **Share the folder** via email, USB, or cloud storage

## Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Check your current IP
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

# Start server with network binding
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0

# Alternative ports if 8000 is blocked
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0
python3 -m http.server 3000 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

## üéØ Recommended for Presentations:
**Use the direct file method** - just double-click `index.html` for immediate access without network dependencies!
